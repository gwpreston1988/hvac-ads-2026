# Buy Comfort Direct
# Google Ads & Merchant Center State Report

**Report Date:** January 14, 2026
**Account ID:** 9256598060
**Currency:** USD
**Time Zone:** America/New_York (Eastern)

---

# SECTION 1 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Are ads currently working?

**Yes.** All three advertising campaigns are active and spending money. Products are appearing in Google Shopping searches, and people are clicking through to the website.

## Are we wasting money on our own brand name?

**No longer.** There was a problem yesterday (January 13) where the Branded campaign was accidentally showing ads for unrelated searches like "hvac parts direct" and "ac warehouse," which cost $232 at very high prices ($15+ per click). This was fixed, and today (January 14) the Branded campaign is only showing for people searching "Buy Comfort Direct" or "BuyComfortDirect" at $0.74 per click with 100% control of those searches.

## Are products showing in Google Shopping?

**Partially.** Out of 1,915 products in the feed:
- **924 products (48%)** are eligible to appear in Shopping
- **991 products (52%)** are not eligible

The eligibility breakdown by our main brands:
- **Rheem:** 199 of 201 eligible (99%) ✓
- **Goodman:** 576 of 577 eligible (100%) ✓
- **Solace:** 18 of 451 eligible (4%) ⚠️

**Note:** Solace products have low eligibility. This may be due to missing product data, pricing issues, or policy violations that should be reviewed in Merchant Center.

## Is anything broken or urgent?

**No immediate emergencies.** The system is functioning. Three items to monitor:

1. **Solace product eligibility** — Most Solace products cannot appear in Shopping. Not urgent but worth investigating.
2. **Hardware Offensive campaign** — Still in learning phase (2 days old). No conversions yet, which is expected.
3. **Auto-apply recommendations** — Should verify in Google Ads that automatic changes are turned OFF.

# SECTION 2 — CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

## What Each Campaign Does

### 1. BCD Branded (Search Campaign)

**Purpose:** Capture people who are already searching for our company by name.

**What it shows for:** Only searches containing "Buy Comfort Direct," "BuyComfortDirect," "BCD," or similar variations of our brand name.

**What it is NOT meant to do:** This campaign should never show ads for generic product searches like "heat pump" or "furnace." Those belong in other campaigns.

**Why it exists:** When someone searches our name specifically, we want to be the top result. Competitors could otherwise bid on our name and steal that traffic. This campaign protects our brand presence at a low cost.

---

### 2. Products Merchant Campaign (Performance Max / PMax)

**Purpose:** Show our products in Google Shopping results when people search for HVAC equipment.

**What it shows for:** Product-related searches like "Rheem heat pump," "Goodman furnace," and general shopping queries. Google automatically matches products from our catalog to relevant searches.

**What it is NOT meant to do:** It should not primarily show for brand searches (people searching "Buy Comfort Direct"). Those should go to the Branded campaign.

**Why it exists:** This is our main product advertising campaign. It displays product images, prices, and ratings directly in Google search results and Shopping tabs.

---

### 3. BCD – Hardware Offensive – 2026 (Search Campaign)

**Purpose:** Test advertising for HVAC industry and technical searches that our other campaigns don't cover.

**What it shows for:** Industry-related searches like "industrial hvac systems," "energy efficient hvac," "heat pump technology," and similar commercial/technical terms.

**What it is NOT meant to do:** This is not meant to compete with Shopping ads or brand searches. It targets a different audience — potentially commercial buyers or researchers.

**Why it exists:** This is an experimental campaign launched recently to explore new customer segments. It's in "learning mode" while Google figures out which searches work best.

---

### 4. Standard Shopping Campaign

**Purpose:** A secondary shopping campaign that is currently inactive.

**Current status:** This campaign received 74 impressions today but no clicks and no spend. It appears to be paused or deprioritized below the PMax campaign.

### Today (January 14)

| Search Term | Impressions | Clicks | Cost |
|-------------|-------------|--------|------|
| buy comfort direct | 4 | 1 | $0.75 |
| buycomfortdirect | 1 | 1 | $0.74 |

**Status: CORRECT ✓** — All traffic is from brand searches only.

---

### Last 7 Days (Including Pre-Fix Data)

The 7-day data includes the period before the fix was applied. Here are the top search terms:

| Search Term | Clicks | Cost | Brand? |

---

## Hardware Offensive — Search Term Analysis

This campaign targets industry and technical searches. Sample terms from the last 7 days:

| Search Term | Clicks | Cost |
|-------------|--------|------|
| industrial hvac systems | 14 | $0.76 |
| energy efficient hvac systems | 10 | $1.16 |
| most efficient heating system | 10 | $0.73 |
| energy efficient hvac systems for commercial buildings | 10 | $0.38 |

| industrial furnace burners | 4 | $0.26 |
| high temperature industrial heat pumps | 4 | $0.23 |
| new heat pump technology | 4 | $0.12 |

**Status: ALIGNED ✓** — Search terms match the campaign's intent (industry/technical searches). Very low CPCs ($0.12–$0.76) indicate efficient traffic acquisition.

---

## PMax Campaign — Traffic Composition

Performance Max campaigns have limited search term visibility by design. Google does not expose individual search terms for PMax in the same way as Search campaigns.

**What we know:**
- The campaign is primarily driving Shopping (product listing) traffic
- It generated 17.8 conversions over 7 days at a 2.73 ROAS
- Brand exclusions should be configured to prevent overlap with the Branded campaign

**Recommendation for verification:** Review PMax asset group settings in Google Ads to confirm brand terms are excluded.

---

# SECTION 5 — MERCHANT CENTER & SHOPPING ELIGIBILITY

## What is Product Eligibility?

"Eligibility" means a product meets Google's requirements to appear in Shopping ads. To be eligible, a product must have:
- Complete product information (title, description, price, image)
- Accurate pricing that matches the website
- Compliance with Google's advertising policies
- Available inventory

Products marked "NOT_ELIGIBLE" will not appear in Shopping results until the issues are resolved.

---

## Overall Product Status

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Eligible | 924 | 48.3% |
| Not Eligible | 991 | 51.7% |
| **Total** | **1,915** | 100% |

---

## Focus Brands — Eligibility Detail

| Brand | Total Products | Eligible | Not Eligible | Eligibility Rate |
|-------|----------------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Rheem | 201 | 199 | 2 | 99% ✓ |
| Goodman | 577 | 576 | 1 | 100% ✓ |
| Solace | 451 | 18 | 433 | 4% ⚠️ |

**Rheem and Goodman:** Nearly all products are eligible and can appear in Shopping ads.

**Solace:** Only 18 of 451 products (4%) are eligible. The remaining 433 products have issues preventing them from appearing. Common causes include:
- Missing required attributes (GTIN, brand, etc.)
- Price mismatches between feed and website
- Policy violations
- Out-of-stock status

---

## Shopping Performance by Brand (Last 7 Days)

| Brand | Impressions | Clicks | Spend | Conversions |

| Goodman | 24,753 | 158 | $181.38 | 0.0 |
| Daikin | 15,363 | 21 | $51.70 | 0.0 |

**Note:** Rheem products receive the most visibility and clicks. Despite low eligibility, some Solace products that are eligible are receiving significant impressions.

# SECTION 6 — BIDDING & COST CONTROL STATUS

## Bidding Strategy by Campaign

| Campaign | Bidding Type | Target ROAS | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| BCD Branded | Manual CPC | N/A | Human-controlled bids |
| Products Merchant (PMax) | Maximize Conversion Value | 1.36 | Automated, targets $1.36 return per $1 spent |
| Hardware Offensive | Maximize Conversion Value | 3.50 | Automated, targets $3.50 return per $1 spent |
| Standard Shopping | Target ROAS | 1.60 | Automated, targets $1.60 return per $1 spent |

---

## Why CPCs Differ by Campaign

### Branded Campaign — Low CPC ($0.74 today)

**Why it's low:** Brand searches have low competition. Few other advertisers bid on "Buy Comfort Direct," so we can win these auctions cheaply. Manual bidding gives full control.

### PMax Campaign — Higher CPC ($1.78–$2.84)

**Why it's higher:** Product Shopping searches are competitive. Many HVAC retailers bid on the same product searches, driving up costs. The automated bidding balances cost against conversion value.

### Hardware Offensive — Very Low CPC ($0.12–$0.17)

**Why it's low:** Industrial/technical searches have less commercial competition. These are exploratory terms where fewer advertisers compete, resulting in low auction prices.

---

## Current CPC Behavior

| Campaign | CPC Status | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| BCD Branded | Stable ✓ | Fixed at ~$0.74, down from $15.23 yesterday |
| Products Merchant | Stable | Consistent $1.78–$2.84 range |
| Hardware Offensive | Learning | Low CPCs expected; may fluctuate as Google optimizes |

---

# SECTION 7 — AUTOMATION & RISK CHECK

## Auto-Applied Recommendations

**Status: REQUIRES MANUAL VERIFICATION**

The Google Ads API cannot directly read whether auto-apply is enabled. This setting must be checked in the Google Ads web interface.

**How to check:**
1. Go to Google Ads → Recommendations
2. Click "Auto-apply" in the top right
3. Verify all auto-apply options are set to OFF

---

## Pending Recommendations

Google has suggested the following changes (NOT automatically applied):

| Recommendation | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| SITELINK_ASSET | Add sitelink extensions |
| CALLOUT_ASSET | Add callout extensions |
| FORECASTING_CAMPAIGN_BUDGET | Adjust budget based on forecast |
| USE_BROAD_MATCH_KEYWORD | Convert keywords to broad match |
| SHOPPING_TARGET_ALL_OFFERS | Target all products in Shopping |

**Action:** These are suggestions only. No changes have been made automatically (assuming auto-apply is OFF).

---

## Recent Automated Changes

No automated changes were detected in this review. The Branded campaign fix on January 13–14 was a manual intervention, not an automated change.

---

# SECTION 8 — WHAT IS WORKING AS INTENDED

✓ **Brand clicks are now inexpensive** — $0.74 per click (target: under $1.00)

✓ **Brand impression share is controlled** — 100% (target: 95–100%)

✓ **Brand search terms are correct** — Only showing for "Buy Comfort Direct" variations

✓ **PMax is spending to daily target** — ~$750/day as expected

✓ **PMax is generating conversions** — 17.8 conversions over 7 days

✓ **Hardware Offensive is actively testing** — Getting clicks at very low cost

✓ **Rheem products are Shopping-eligible** — 99% eligibility

✓ **Goodman products are Shopping-eligible** — 100% eligibility

✓ **Conversion tracking is configured** — Purchase, Phone Calls, and Calls from Ads are all set as Primary conversions

---

# SECTION 9 — WHAT IS STILL EARLY / LEARNING

## Hardware Offensive Campaign

**Status:** Learning Phase (2 days old)

**What to expect:**
- No conversions yet — this is normal for a new campaign
- CPCs may fluctuate as Google's algorithm learns
- "Low volume" warnings may appear — these are informational, not errors

**Why this is not urgent:** New campaigns typically need 2–4 weeks of data before performance stabilizes. The current low CPCs and relevant search terms are positive early indicators.

---

## Solace Product Eligibility

**Status:** Under Investigation

**What we know:**
- Only 4% of Solace products are eligible for Shopping
- The products that are eligible are receiving impressions

**Why this is not urgent:** Rheem and Goodman (which represent the majority of high-value inventory) are fully eligible. Solace issues should be reviewed but are not blocking overall Shopping performance.

---

## Branded Campaign — Post-Fix Monitoring

**Status:** Recently Fixed

**What happened:** The Branded campaign was showing for non-brand searches until January 13. This was corrected, and January 14 data shows the fix is working.

**Why monitoring continues:** A few more days of data will confirm the fix is stable and no new leakage occurs.

---

# SECTION 10 — NEXT REVIEW CHECKPOINTS

**Observe:**

---
