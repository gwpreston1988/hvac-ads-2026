EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Both non-branded campaigns use MAXIMIZE_CONVERSION_VALUE smart bidding.
NO MANUAL CPC CONTROLS ARE AVAILABLE in either campaign.

The Google rep configured smart bidding on all campaigns, which means:
- You cannot set max CPC caps
- Keyword-level bids are ignored
- Ad group bids are ignored
- The only cost levers are: target ROAS and daily budget

   campaigns. This removes manual CPC control entirely.

   The $3-4 ad group bids are set but completely ignored by smart bidding.
