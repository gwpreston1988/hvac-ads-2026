# Legacy Code - QUARANTINED

**DO NOT USE these scripts for production operations.**

This folder contains old scripts that have been quarantined during the repo cleanup. They are preserved for reference but should NOT be used.

## Why Quarantined?

These scripts were created before the baseline pipeline was established. They may:

1. **Make unexpected API calls** - Some scripts read from or write to live APIs without clear separation
2. **Lack guardrails** - No snapshot isolation, no DRY_RUN mode, no explicit flags
3. **Have unclear behavior** - Mixed read/write operations, unclear preconditions
4. **Use outdated patterns** - Different data formats, different credential loading

## What To Use Instead

Use the baseline pipeline in `core/` via the `bin/` wrappers:

| Old Script | New Equivalent |
|------------|----------------|
| Any state dump | `bin/dump` |
| Any report | `bin/report --latest` |
| Any proposed changes | `bin/plan --latest` |
| Any execution | `bin/apply <plan>.json` |

## Contents

### `audit/` - Old Audit Scripts

| File | Description | Why Quarantined |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `budget_balancer.py` | Budget optimization | May make budget changes |
| `execute_branded_restore.py` | Branded campaign restore | Direct API writes |
| `execute_containment.py` | Containment actions | Direct API writes |
| `execute_live.py` | Live execution | Direct API writes |
| `execute_phase1.py` | Phase 1 execution | Direct API writes |
| `generate_exclusion_feed.py` | Exclusion feed generator | Unclear API behavior |
| `keyword_conflicts.py` | Keyword conflict detection | May make API calls |
| `master_scaling_audit.py` | Scaling audit | May make API calls |
| `pmax_brand_leakage.py` | PMax brand leakage | May make API calls |
| `product_pmax_correlation.py` | Product correlation | May make API calls |

### `scripts/` - Old Utility Scripts

| File | Description | Why Quarantined |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `exchange_code.py` | OAuth code exchange | Credential management |
| `generate_oauth_token.py` | OAuth token generation | Credential management |
| `seo_state_dump_rheem.py` | Rheem SEO dump | Old dump format |

### `seo/` - Old SEO Scripts

BigCommerce SEO scripts. Quarantined because they use different data models and may make direct API calls.

### `docs/` - Old Documentation

Old documentation that may reference deprecated patterns.

### `reports/` - Old Report Files

Historical report files from before the baseline pipeline. Preserved for reference but not generated by current tools.

### `output/` - Old Output Files

Old output files from legacy scripts.

## If You Need This Functionality

1. **Check if `core/` already does it** - The baseline pipeline may already cover your use case
2. **Extract and refactor** - Pull the relevant logic into a new `core/` module with proper guardrails
3. **Use as reference only** - Read the old code to understand the approach, then implement properly
4. **Ask the team** - Before running any legacy code, consult with the team

## Quarantine Date

All scripts in this folder were quarantined on **2026-01-16** during the baseline pipeline cleanup.
