# CURRENT BID STRATEGY CONFIGURATION

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Bidding Strategy** | Maximize Conversion Value |
| **Target ROAS** | 1.36 (136%) |
| **Daily Budget** | $500.00 |
| **Delivery Method** | Standard |
| **Status** | Enabled |

**What This Means:**
- Google automatically sets bids to maximize total conversion value (revenue)
- The 1.36 target tells Google to aim for $1.36 in revenue for every $1.00 spent
- If the system can't hit 1.36 ROAS, it will still spend but optimize for maximum value

# BID STRATEGY INTERPRETATION

## What the Current Settings Mean

**Maximize Conversion Value with 1.36 Target ROAS:**

1. Google's algorithm will bid higher for searches/audiences likely to generate high-value conversions
2. The 1.36 target is a **soft constraint** — Google will try to hit this but may spend below if it can't find valuable traffic
3. This is more aggressive than a pure Target ROAS strategy, which would throttle spend more strictly

## Historical Performance vs Target

| Period | Actual ROAS | Target ROAS | Variance |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 30-Day Average | 2.54 | 1.36 | +87% above target |
| Last 7 Days | 2.56 | 1.36 | +88% above target |
| Week 3 (worst) | 0.46 | 1.36 | -66% below target |
| Week 1 (best) | 4.88 | 1.36 | +259% above target |

**Conclusion:** The campaign is generally exceeding its target ROAS, except during the post-holiday week (Dec 29-Jan 4) when performance dropped significantly.

---

# BUDGET UTILIZATION

| Budget Setting | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Daily Budget | $500.00 |
| Avg Daily Spend (30 days) | $611.07 |
| Highest Daily Spend | $1,354.78 (Jan 5) |
| Lowest Daily Spend | $168.09 (Jan 11) |

**Note:** The campaign is exceeding its $500 daily budget on many days. This suggests the budget may have been recently reduced, or Google is allowed to exceed daily limits (up to 2x) to capture opportunities.
